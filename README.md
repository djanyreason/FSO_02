This repository is for exercises in Part 2 of Full Stack Open (FSO), "Communicating with server" - https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2

The exercises in this part are all basic front-end-only web apps built in React. However, they do interact with local and remote servers through Axios.

There are three projects contained in this repository, each in their own subfolder:

* /course_information - a web app that displays the parts (or sections) and number of exercises in each part for a series of web development courses
* /phonebook - a web app that presents a personal "phonebook" contact list of names and phone number, with filter/search capability and the ability to add and remove entries
* /data_for_countries - a web app that searches for countries by a string entered, providing a list of all matching countries if multiple are found, and if only one is found additional details about that country
