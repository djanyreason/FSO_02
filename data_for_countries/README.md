This folder contains the Data for countries project which is developed in exercises 2.18-2.20 of Full Stack Open part 2: https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/adding_styles_to_react_app#exercises-2-18-2-20

This web app allows the user to search for a country. If only one country matches, details for that country are displayed such as its capital, flag image, and weather report. If multiple countries match the entered text, it lists them all (with a maximum limit of 10), with buttons to show the details for each. The data used are accessed via API requests to remote services.

This project is built using React. Communications with the remote server are handled with axios. It involves using forms managed through state variables, reading data from a remote service, and styling text and elements using CSS within react.
