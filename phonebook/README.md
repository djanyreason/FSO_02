This web app displays a users contact list with names and phone numbers, along with the ability to search/filter the entries, add new entries, and delete entries. The phonebook data is stored in db.json, and is made available via a local server through json-server. The app displays status and error messages for successful or failed database changes. 

This project is built using React. Communications with the local server are handled with axios. It involves using forms managed through state variables, reading data from a remote service, writing and modifying data in a remote service, handling errors in communicating with a server, and styling text and elements using CSS within react.
